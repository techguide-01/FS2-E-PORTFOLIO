                <h3>Cutting Rigid Steel Conduit</h3>
                <p>

                    The seventh week of observation in Mr. Sunny Diche's TLE - Electrical Installation and Maintenance classes at Eulogio Rodriguez Integrated School marked another unique opportunity as I assumed the role of the teacher. This week's focus centered on the critical skill of cutting Rigid Steel Conduit (RSC). The experience provided a platform to delve into the intricacies of teaching a technical skill while ensuring safety and effective knowledge transfer.
                    
                    Preparation for the lesson on cutting Rigid Steel Conduit involved meticulous planning and collaboration with Mr. Diche. The lesson plan encompassed an overview of the importance of RSC, safety considerations, the selection of appropriate tools, and the step-by-step process of executing accurate cuts. Visual aids, including diagrams and samples of RSC, were incorporated to enhance comprehension.
                    
                    The lesson began with a comprehensive introduction to the significance of RSC in electrical installations. The importance of precise cutting to ensure a proper conduit run was emphasized, providing context to the practical skill that would be explored during the session. Students were encouraged to share their understanding of RSC and its applications.
                    
                    Given the nature of working with RSC, a dedicated safety briefing preceded the practical demonstration. Students were reminded of the specific safety protocols associated with cutting RSC, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), maintaining a clean workspace, and the proper handling of cutting tools. The emphasis on safety aimed to instill a culture of responsibility in handling potentially hazardous materials.
                    
                    A substantial part of the class was dedicated to a hands-on demonstration of cutting Rigid Steel Conduit. Using appropriate tools such as hacksaws and pipe cutters, I guided students through the process, emphasizing key measurements, marking techniques, and the application of steady cutting motions. The practical session allowed students to witness the precision required for successful conduit cuts.

                    To promote active learning, students were provided with the opportunity to practice cutting RSC individually. I circulated among the students, offering guidance, checking their techniques, and providing constructive feedback. This interactive approach ensured that each student had the opportunity to apply the theoretical knowledge to the practical task, reinforcing their understanding of the skill.
                    
                    Following the hands-on session, a post-practical discussion was conducted. This forum allowed students to share their experiences, ask questions, and seek clarification on any aspects of cutting RSC. The discussion provided valuable insights into areas that required additional reinforcement and facilitated a collective reflection on the practical application of the skill.
                    
                    The seventh week of observation, where I took on the responsibility of teaching the skill of cutting Rigid Steel Conduit, was a pivotal experience. The collaborative planning with Mr. Diche, the emphasis on safety, and the interactive nature of the practical session contributed to a robust and engaging learning environment. As the observation period progresses, this week's experience deepens the understanding of effective teaching strategies within the realm of TLE - Electrical Installation and Maintenance.

                <h3>Bending Using Hickey</h3>
                <p>
                    In the eighth and final week of observation in Mr. Sunny Diche's TLE - Electrical Installation and Maintenance classes at Eulogio Rodriguez Integrated School, a significant opportunity emerged as I took charge of teaching the class about bending using a hickey. This week provided a culmination of the observed teaching methodologies and hands-on skills, encapsulating the essence of the TLE curriculum.
                    
                    Preparation for the lesson on bending using a hickey involved careful planning and coordination with Mr. Diche. The lesson plan encompassed an in-depth explanation of the significance of bending in conduit installations, the role of a hickey in the process, and the step-by-step procedure for executing bends. Visual aids, including diagrams and a demonstration hickey, were employed to enhance understanding.
                    
                    The lesson commenced with a thorough introduction to the importance of bending in conduit installations. The concept of using a hickey as a bending tool was explained, and the significance of precise bends in achieving optimal conduit runs was highlighted. Students were encouraged to reflect on the relevance of bending techniques in real-world electrical installations.
                    
                    As with previous practical lessons, a dedicated safety briefing preceded the hands-on demonstration. Students were reminded of the specific safety protocols associated with bending using a hickey, including the proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and maintaining awareness of the workspace. The emphasis on safety aimed to instill a culture of responsibility and vigilance during practical tasks.
                    
                    A substantial portion of the class was dedicated to a hands-on demonstration of bending using a hickey. I guided students through the process, demonstrating the correct positioning of the hickey, the application of force, and the creation of various bends. The practical session allowed students to witness firsthand the skill and precision required for successful conduit bending.
                    
                    To reinforce the learning, students were provided with the opportunity to practice bending using a hickey individually. I circulated among the students, offering guidance, checking their techniques, and providing constructive feedback. This interactive approach ensured that each student had the opportunity to apply the theoretical knowledge to the practical task, fostering a deeper understanding of the skill.
                    
                    Following the hands-on session, a post-practical discussion allowed students to share their experiences, ask questions, and seek clarification on any aspects of bending using a hickey. The discussion provided insights into areas that required additional reinforcement and facilitated a collective reflection on the practical application of the skill.
                    
                    The eighth week of observation, where I had the opportunity to teach about bending using a hickey, marked the conclusion of the observed teaching experience. The collaborative planning with Mr. Diche, the emphasis on safety, and the hands-on nature of the practical session contributed to a comprehensive learning experience. As the observation period concludes, the collective experiences of the past weeks have deepened the understanding of effective teaching strategies within the realm of TLE - Electrical Installation and Maintenance. The journey has been enriching, and the insights gained will undoubtedly contribute to my growth as an educator.

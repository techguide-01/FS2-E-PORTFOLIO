                <h3>Observation of teaching</h3>
                <p>
                    In the first week of observation at Eulogio Rodriguez Integrated School, I had the privilege of immersing myself in the dynamic teaching environment of Mr. Sunny Diche's class. Mr. Diche teaches Technology and Livelihood Education (TLE) with a focus on Electrical Installation and Maintenance. Throughout the week, I observed six classes per day, providing a comprehensive insight into the instructional strategies and learning atmosphere within the classroom.
                    
                    Upon entering Mr. Diche's classroom, I immediately noticed a well-organized and inviting space. The walls were adorned with charts and diagrams related to electrical circuits, safety protocols, and key concepts in Electrical Installation and Maintenance. The arrangement of desks facilitated easy movement and interaction among students, fostering a conducive environment for learning.
                    
                    Mr. Diche's teaching style was characterized by a harmonious blend of traditional instruction and modern pedagogical methods. Each class began with a clear and concise introduction to the day's topic, often accompanied by engaging anecdotes or real-world applications. He seamlessly integrated multimedia presentations, practical demonstrations, and interactive discussions to cater to diverse learning preferences.
                    
                    A standout feature of Mr. Diche's classes was the emphasis on hands-on learning. In alignment with the TLE curriculum, students actively participated in practical exercises related to Electrical Installation and Maintenance. From wiring circuits to troubleshooting electrical systems, the hands-on activities provided students with valuable experiential learning opportunities, reinforcing theoretical concepts.
                    
                    Throughout the observation period, it was evident that Mr. Diche maintained a positive and inclusive classroom culture. He skillfully encouraged student participation, inviting questions and facilitating discussions that allowed students to express their understanding of the material. The rapport between teacher and students contributed to a collaborative learning environment.
                    
                    Given the nature of the subject, safety was a recurring theme in Mr. Diche's class. Before engaging in any practical activities, he consistently emphasized the importance of adhering to safety protocols and wearing the necessary protective equipment. This conscientious approach demonstrated not only Mr. Diche's commitment to student well-being but also instilled a sense of responsibility among the students.
                    
                    The first week of observation in Mr. Sunny Diche's TLE - Electrical Installation and Maintenance classes at Eulogio Rodriguez Integrated School was a rich and insightful experience. The combination of effective teaching strategies, hands-on learning, student engagement, and a strong focus on safety collectively contributed to a vibrant and conducive learning environment. I look forward to further weeks of observation, anticipating continued valuable insights into the realm of Electrical Installation and Maintenance education under Mr. Diche's guidance.
